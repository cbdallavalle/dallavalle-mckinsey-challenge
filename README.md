## Synopsis

Casey Dallavalle's submission for the Digital McKinsey Coding Challenge.

## Application Explanation

A basic calendar is displayed that allows the user to switch back and forth between months. Holidays for March and April are displayed. Users can click on a day to add an event, which will appear on the day after the submit button is clicked.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Clone this repo by running this command in the terminal: ```git clone https://github.com/cbdallavalle/dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge.git dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge```. I provided the repo name dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge, but you may change the name to whatever you prefer.

``cd`` into the directory and run ```npm install```

Lastly, ```npm start``` will start the application on your localhost. 

## Thank you

Thank you so very much for your time and consideration. I enjoyed working on this code challenge and please let me know if you have any further questions about my submission. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to submit my application. Digital presence is critical for any company, whether they are small or large, and I appreciate the dedication and commitment McKinsey Digital gives to transform their clients online capabilities. 

I would be proud to work with McKinsey Digital to further their mission and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Casey Dallavalle
