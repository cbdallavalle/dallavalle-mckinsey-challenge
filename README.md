## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Application Explanation

A basic calendar is displayed that allows the user to switch back and forth between months. Holidays for March and April are displayed. Users can click on a day to add an event, which will appear on the day after the submit button is clicked.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Clone this repo by running this command in the terminal: ```git clone https://github.com/cbdallavalle/dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge.git dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge```. I provided the repo name dallavalle-mckinsey-challenge, but you may change the name to whatever you prefer.

``cd`` into the directory and run ```npm install``
